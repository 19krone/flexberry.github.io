## Description 

Internationalization in the addon ember-flexberry based on [ember-i18n](https://github.com/jamesarosen/ember-i18n). 
Ember-service `i18n` described [here](https://github.com/jamesarosen/ember-i18n/wiki/Doc:-i18n-Service), is introduced during application initialization in all components, controllers, ranting, models and views. 

## Initialize locale 
By default, when you run the application sets the locale corresponding to the language of the browser: `navigator.language || navigator.userLanguage`. To change the current locale you need in your code to assign the property `locale` service `i18n`: 

```javascript
this.set('i18n.locale', 'ru');
``` 

All localized values in the app will be changed to the corresponding locale installed. 
By default the locale to located in the folder `app/locales` addon ember-flexberry. There you can see available keys for localization, the purpose of which the names and the hierarchy. 

## Substitution of values for the current locale 

If you want to implement the change specific labels, it can be done using the method `addTranslations` service `i18n`, putting the locale key and its value as described [sdes](https://github.com/jamesarosen/ember-i18n/wiki/Doc:-Defining-Translations#defining-translations-at-runtime).
