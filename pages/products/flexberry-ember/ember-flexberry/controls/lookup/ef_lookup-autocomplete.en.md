If there is a need for sorting hidden fields when using auto-completion, you should use a property `autocompleteOrder`. To this end, the application template, you must add this property to specify the fields by which to sort and the sort direction. For example: 

```hbs
autocompleteOrder="moderated asc, parent desc"
``` 

## Mode autocomplete with automatic selection according to the value entered 

In this mode: 
1. While typing in auto-completion of values that is not in the directory, it is not reset, but is set to an empty reference to a dictionary. 
2. While typing in auto-completion values, which is in the directory, set the reference to the dictionary.

This can be useful if introduced in lookup the value to be stored in a separate field, even if the reference lucapa this value is not. 

To enable this mode, you should `autocompletePersistValue` property is set to true and the property `displayValue` bind on the field to which you want to save displayed in lucapa value. 

```hbs
{% raw %}
{{flexberry-lookup
        ...

	autocomplete=true
	autocompletePersistValue=true
	displayValue=model.lookupDisplayValue
}}{% endraw %}
```
