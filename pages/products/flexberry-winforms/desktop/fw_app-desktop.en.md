To indicate the composition of starters and placing the menu items, you should overload the Adjuster desktop method `GetRunners()` that returns a one-dimensional array of starters `ICSSoft.STORMNET.UI.Runner`.

* `ICSSoft.STORMNET.UI.ContRunner` — starter independent list container, simultaneously launching in the container the script for execution. Has a property type of the container. Method `Run()` overloaded in such a way that builds a container, takes the script and runs it. 
* `ICSSoft.STORMNET.UI.ScriptRunner` — starter script, located in the specified type implementing the interface `Scriptizer.DataObjects.IScripted`. Method `Run()` overloaded in such a way that launches this script.

* `GetBigImage(), GetImage()` to change the icons стартера; 
* `Run()` to implement the steps that occur when you select from the desktop.

In the form of desktop applications (<ApplicationName>Desktop.cs in the initial design) object of type desktopCtrl2 ICSSoft.STORMNET.Windows.Forms.DesktopCtrl has the following properties: 
* __SortRunners__ is responsible for sorting of items in tree and list: 
* _true_ - alphabetical order 
* _false_ - without sorting, the order matches the order of the tasks in Flexberry 
* __ViewMode__ is responsible for the type of display list elements (icons, list, table)
